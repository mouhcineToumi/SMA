##### sync with repo

# if first time
git clone https://github.com/mouhcineToumi/SMA

# if just to sync with new changes
git checkout master
git pull
```


##### branch workflow

create a branch 
```
git branch branch_name
```

get inside a branch

```
git checkout branch_name
```

sync branch with master ( if needed )
```
git merge master
```

do some work
```
better not to work wih someone on smth at the same time ( like editing the same file)
because you ll end up with merge conflict
that s why we divide the work
```

push changes to master
```
git add --all
git commit -m 'a meaninful message about what you did in the commit'
git push
```
